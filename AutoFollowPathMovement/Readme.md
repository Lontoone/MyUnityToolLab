It contains 3 scripts:
- CartMoveControl.cs
  - Put it onto the object you want it to move and asign the first 2 points to it.
- CartStopPoint.cs
  - Put it on every point of the curve, and asign right, left handle.
- CartStopsManager.cs
  - Use it to store move points. (It is the parent of points and uses index of hierarchy to sort them.)
